Description: The Mergeomics pipeline serves as a flexible framework for 
    integrating multidimensional omics-disease associations, functional
    genomics,  canonical pathways and gene-gene interaction networks to
    generate mechanistic hypotheses. It includes two main parts,
    1) Marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA); 
    2) Weighted Key Driver Analysis (wKDA).
